## PC Builder

The goal of this project is to build a user-friendly and efficient PC Builder website that allows users to easily select and assemble PC parts and components to build their customized personal computer. The website will be developed using Next.js, a popular React framework for server-side rendering and building modern web applications. The primary focus will be on creating a clean and straightforward user interface to enhance the user experience.

#### Key Features:

PC Builder Tool: The core feature of the website is the PC Builder tool, which enables users to create their custom PCs. Users can browse through a comprehensive list of PC parts and components such as processors, graphics cards, memory modules, storage drives, power supplies, and cases. They can then select and add these components to their build.

Component Selection: Each PC component will have detailed information, specifications, and user reviews to assist users in making informed decisions. A user-friendly search and filtering system will help users quickly find the components they need.

User Accounts: Users will have the option to create accounts to save their PC builds, access them from any device, and modify them over time. Registered users will also receive personalized recommendations based on their build history and preferences.

User Reviews and Ratings: Users will be able to leave reviews and ratings for components they have used. This feature will aid other users in making choices based on real-world experiences.

Responsive Design: The website will be optimized for various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, to ensure a seamless browsing experience across all platforms.
